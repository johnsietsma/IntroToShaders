**Description**

Shaders open up a new world of visual effects. In this 1 hour long, beginner level session you’ll learn the basics of vertex and fragment shader programming. You’ll find out what shaders are and learn techniques you can apply to your game. This session covers:

* What are vertex and fragment shaders?
* Texturing and shader properties
* UV scrolling
* Texture distortion
* Texture masking
* Clipping
* Controlling shader properties in code and through animation.

It doesn't cover Surface shaders or lighting.
